# uno-devcontainer-template

This repository contains:
- an Uno Platform application created using the recommended template
- a dev container configuration for web assembly development

Simply spin up the container and wait for `postCreateCommand.sh` and `postAttachCommand.sh` to finish.

Creation of the `solution-config.props` file was deliberately ommitted from the script.
